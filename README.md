# UFOs
## Overview
We are not a lone. Nor is our data alone now, as we can now share our application to the world (and potentially the universe if they have internet access. 

Our website now highlights data points that are searchable of confirmed "UFO" sitings across the country. A preview of the main page can be seen here:

## Results
As requested, we have added a filtering function for individuals to look closer at our data. 
### Pre-Filter Appearance
When the user goes to our data page, they will see the below screen:

From here, we can input dates, cities, states, and shapes to narrow down our data points.  It comes with the ease for the user to only have to type and hit enter for the filter to appear
### Post-Filter
After any or all categories are filled, the filter data returned. The below is an example of data filtered for the state of California:

## Next Steps/Process Improvements/ Summary
We are now able to share our data with other "truthers," but this does not come without some ideas on how to build towards the future:
- We should regularly mine for additional data so we can be as up to date as possible. We would need to decide the frequence of data updates to execute this appropriately
- The new design does filter efficiently, but is not clear on what available data points there are. I am sure most users are entering our site to look at confirmed sitings in their state or town. We could add a drop down of available filters to further narrow individuals initial search
- We are currently set up to limit filtering to the 5 parameters selected. We can add an additionl 2 filter columns for duration and comments. However, we would need to clean the duration column to a uniform time element for best filtering.
